Version 1.01:
  Added autoconf support.
  Separated include files into three subdirectories:
    pub_include - the files xparam.h and xparam_extend.h
    xparam - files included by the files in pub_include
    src_include - files used in compiling libxparam.a
  By default, you should now use <xparam.h> and <xparam_extend.h>
  instead of <xparam/xparam.h> and <xparam/xparam_extend.h>. The
  previous method will still work, but is considered depreciated.

Version 1.02:
  Added support for user defined symbolic constants.

Version 1.1:
  Added enum support.
  Added the ability to query parameters.
  Added parameter set manipulators.
  Added match-by-prefix option.
  Added first-assignment-holds and multiple-assignment-is-error options.
  Added the ability to import paramsets into other paramsets.
  Added support for using constant variables as output variables in ParamSets.
  Added regression testing.
  Added libtool support.
  Improved installation.

Version 1.11:
  Changed parser so reading a value requires no lookahead besides WS.
  Added all built-in C types (including non-standard extensions).
  More compatibility with different compilers.

Version 1.2:
  Added built-in support for std::map, std::list and std::pair.
  Created special syntax for std::map.
  Exported the mechanism for creating new template registration commands.
  Changed the registration process so that registration is delayed as
    much as possible, to avoid running code prior to main(). Optionally,
    the user can forbid registration until a run point of her choice.
  Added the "PENDING" directive.
  Duplicate registration is no longer an error.
  All Unix xp_config.h directives have been replaced by autoconf tests.
  Assorted bug fixes and small improvements.

  Improved installation (make depend, DESTDIR, cxxflags-enable, ldconfig, etc.)
  Added a FAQ page.
  Added documentation in linuxdoc sgml and GNU info formats.
  Small bug fixes and code improvements.

Version 1.22:
  Added globbing capability.
  New "basic type": RawBytes, for space-efficient storage.
  Now supporting a feedback stream for ParamSets.
  New ParamSet flag: Ignore unexpected.
  Now reporting warnings to the user, with ability to set warning level.
  Better error reporting: MatchError
  Default values now supported in XParam input format, as well as C++.
