<A NAME="general"><H4>General</H4></A>
In general, the user interface provided by XParam tries to look and
feel as much like object construction inside a C++ program as
possible. Some features have been added, to make XParam more convenient
for its particular usage, but as a general guideline it would be
fair to assume that if something is a legal object construction
sequence in C++, it would also be recognizeable by XParam.
<A NAME="parametersets"><H4>Parameter Sets</H4></A>
The most straight-forward usage of XParam is to read a parameter set
from the command line. It looks something like this:
<P>
<TT>
~/bin&gt;a.out name=Mary age=17 height=1.6
</TT>
<P>
A parameter set is list of parameters, each of the form
<TT><I>parameter_name</I> = <I>parameter_value</I></TT>. In this
example, we assigned a value to three parameters: parameter "name"
was assigned the value "Mary", parameter "age" was assigned the
value "17", and parameter "height" was assigned the value "1.6".
XParam is not sensitive to the order in which the parameters are
assigned, so it would have been equivalent to write "age=17 name=Mary
height=1.6".
<P>
The parameter set is also insensitive to
white space, if it is not inside a parameter name or
a parameter value. So "name=Mary" is equivalent to "name  =  Mary",
but not to "na me=Mary" or to "name=Ma ry". In the sections dealing
with parameter values, we will go over special cases in which
spacing and tabulation are allowed inside a parameter value.
<P>
Parameter sets do not have to be read only from the command line.
A Parameter set may appear in a file, or may originate from any input
stream. If this is the case, line breaks are also permitted where
spacing and tabulation are permitted, with the exception noted
in <A HREF="#complexparametervalues">Complex Parameter Values</A>.
<P>
You can add one semicolon to indicate the end of a parameter set, but
this is not required. It is
particularly useful if you're reading the parameter set from a stream.
In this case, the semicolon will terminate the reading of the parameter
set, even if the end of the stream has not been reached. Use this
option if you want to read several parameter sets consecutively from
a stream.
<P>
All information in a parameter set is case sensitive.
<A NAME="gettinghelp"><H4>Getting Help</H4></A>
Possibly the first thing you'll want to do when encountering a
program is to find out what input it expects. You can do this, in
XParam, by executing the program with one of the following as its
single argument: "!", "/h", "/H", "/?", "/help", "-?" or "--help".
This will result in a table similar to the following being printed:
<P>
<PRE>
This program determines whether the applicant will get the job.

Usage: progname &lt;param1&gt;=&lt;val1&gt; &lt;param2&gt;=&lt;val2&gt; -&lt;flag1&gt; -no_&lt;flag2&gt;...
Use any unambiguous prefix of the parameter names
In case of multiple assignment to the same parameter, the last holds.

Name       Type   I/O Default Value Description
====       ====   === ============= ===========
name       string  I  [ required ]  Applicant's name
age        int     I  [ required ]  Applicant's age
height     double  I  [ required ]  Applicant's height in meters
experience int     I  0             Years of experience the applicant has
result     bool    O                Did the applicant get the job?
</PRE>
<P>
This table indicates that there are five parameters in this set, only
four of which are input parameters. The program expects you to enter
a "name" parameter, an "age" parameter and a "height" parameter, for
these are all required values. If you do not enter these, XParam
will inform the program that certain parameters are missing, and most
likely the program will print an error and abort. On the other hand,
the fourth input parameter, "experience", will default to zero unless
otherwise stated.
<P>
The fifth parameter, "result", is an output parameter. In XParam, one
can define parameters to be output only, indicated by "O", as is "result",
or to be used in both input and output, indicated by "I/O". The customary
way of using XParam will lead all the output and input/output parameters
to be printed out to the standard output at the end of the program's run
in the same format as the input, so that programs using
XParam parameter handling can be piped into each other. The programmer,
however, may circumvent this at will. A more detailed discussion of this
appears in the <A HREF="programmer.html#paramset">ParamSet</A> section
of <A HREF="programmer.html">The Programmer Interface</A>.
<P>
As can be seen, the parameters are all strictly typed. Entering "17.5"
as Mary's age would have resulted in a conversion. Using "medium" as her
height would have resulted in an error.
All user-errors detected by XParam are handled by
throwing the relevant exceptions to the main program. The program
can then handle the error as the programmer sees fit. For the
purpose of this document, we will assume that the programmer chose
to report the error and halt, which is the most simple and common
thing to do.
<P>
In the section <A HREF="#complexparametervalues">Complex Parameter
Values</A>, a second method for getting help in XParam is discussed.
<A NAME="modes"><H4>Input Modes</H4></A>
You may have noted the two lines above the table of parameters:
<P>
<PRE>
Use any unambiguous prefix of the parameter names
In case of multiple assignment to the same parameter, the last holds.
</PRE>
<P>
These lines inform you of the input mode the programmer has chosen for
this program. XParam can recognize parameters by any unique prefix of
their names, or it may require you to enter the full name of the parameter.
<P>
XParam can also handle multiple assignments to the same parameter in
several different ways, which are chosen by the programmer. XParam's
default mode is that the last assignment holds. However, the programmer
can change this so that the first assignment will hold, or so that
multiple assignments to the same parameter are considered an error.
<P>
When you execute the program with "--help" or an equivalent option,
XParam tells you what its current mode of operation is, so that you
know how to enter your data correctly.
<P>
Note: In prefix mode, if two of your parameters have names that are
prefixes of each other, this does not cause ambiguities. XParam will
always opt for the shortest match. So, if "munch" and "munchkin" are
both names of parameters the program, the input "mu" will only match
"munch", whereas "munchk" will only match "munchkin".
<P>
<A NAME="comments"><H4>Comments</H4></A>
If your parameter set is not on the command line, you can add comments
to it. The character "#" signifies the start of a comment, whether it appears
in the middle of a line or in the beginning. The comment continues
until the end of the line, and stops there.
So, you can have an input file that looks
like this:
<P>
<TT>
#File: marydata.txt<BR>
#This is the applicant that seems most likely to get the job.<BR>
name=Mary<BR>
age=17 # Her only problem is that she's a little young for the job.<BR>
height=1.6<BR>
</TT>
<P>
Comments are allowed in almost any place where spacing and tabulation are
permitted.
<A NAME="redirection"><H4>Redirection</H4></A>
If you want to input many parameters, or if your parameter values are
very long and complex, you probably don't want to keep them on the
command-line. It would be more convenient for you to keep them in a
file, where you can edit them and re-use them at will. To help you,
XParam provides two different redirection features.
<P>
The simpler of the two redirection features is parameter-set redirection.
Using it, you can read some or all of your parameters from a file.
For example, if you write, on the command-line
<P>
<TT>
~/bin&gt;a.out @marydata.txt experience=2
</TT>
<P>
XParam will recognize the "@" redirection symbol, and will first read
the "name", "age" and "height" parameters from the file "marydata.txt",
before returning to parse the rest of the command-line, and reading
"experience" from it. You can redirect to as many files as you want
on a single command-line, and these redirections can appear in any
order and in any place where a list of parameters is expected.
<P>
Nested redirections are also permitted. That is, the file "marydata.txt"
may also contain a "@" redirection that will direct some or all of the
parameters to be read from a second file, and so on. XParam does not
limit the depth of such multiple redirections, but circular redirections
are not allowed.
<P>
The second form of redirection is to redirect a
single parameter value. This form also uses the "@" redirection symbol,
and looks like this:
<P>
<TT>
~/bin&gt;a.out name= @namedata.txt age= @agedata.txt height= @heightdata.txt
</TT>
</P>
If you have parameters that have very long and complex values, or if you
plan on reusing values, you may find this redirection scheme very useful.
This form of redirection can be used in any context where a value is
expected.
<P>
The file to which you are redirecting, in this case, can include comments,
but beside the comments only the value should appear. For example:
<P>
<TT>
#File: agedata.txt<BR>
#Mary may be a little too young for this job.<BR>
17<BR>
</TT>
<P>
Though XParam is mostly used to read parameter sets, it also allows the
programmer to read and write single values. Using this feature, a
program can read "agedata.txt" directly. In any case, nested redirections
are allowed here, too.
<P>
If you want to redirect part of your input to be read from the standard
input (for example, if you want to pipe an entire parameter set from
one program to another), use "@stdin".
<A NAME="basicparametervalues"><H4>Basic Parameter Values</H4></A>
In general, XParam recognizes the built-in C++ types, as they are recognized
inside a C++ program: 7 denotes an integer, '7' - a character, "7" -
a string, 7U - an unsigned int, 7L - a long int and 7UL - an unsigned long
int, 7.0 - a double, 7.0f - a float. On systems where long double is
supported, 7.0L will be considered a long double. If long long is supported,
XParam will recognize integer values larger than the capacity of a "long"
variable as long long, or as unsigned long long, if they are followed by
the letter 'U'. An 'L' following long long and unsigned long long is also
allowed. Note that XParam distinguishes
between a string and a pointer to a char, and that, unlike in C++, the string
"7" will be recognized as an std::string in XParam, and not as a pointer
to a char.
A more in-depth discussion of this can be found in the
<A HREF="registration.html#argumentpassers">Argument Passers</A> section
of the <A HREF="registration.html">Registration Interface</A>.
<P>
In strings and in characters, XParam also recognizes the '\n' format for
special characters, as well as hexadecimal notation: '\x0D'. Note that
if you're using hexadecimal character notation, you must enter exactly
two hexadecimal digits: both '\xD' and '\x00D' are mistakes. Integers
can be input in decimal (<TT>17</TT>), hexadecimal (<TT>0x11</TT>),
octal (<TT>021</TT>) or binary (<TT>0b1001</TT>).
Floating point numbers observe the standard C++ notation, so all
the following examples are correct forms of doubles: <TT>17.6</TT>,
<TT>1.76E1</TT>, <TT>+01.7600e+01</TT>, etc.
Using the '\c' notation in conjunction with characters that have no
special meaning ('\c', '\d', '\0', etc.) will be interpreted as using
the character itself (so this is equivalent to 'c', 'd' and '0',
respectively). Naturally '\\' is used to denote a backslash, '\"',
when in a string literal, denotes quotation marks and '\'', when in
a character literal, denotes an apostrophe.
<P>
As in C++, comments, spacing and tabulation are not allowed within any
of these literal constants. However, outside literal constants, comments
spacing, line breaking and tabulation are allowed in any place within
the definition of a parameter value.
<A NAME="complexparametervalues"><H4>Complex Parameter Values</H4></A>
XParam's main strength is in its extendability. You do not have to limit
yourself to the built-in C++ types, but can use any class you wish.
The way this is done is as follows: every class in C++ can be constructed
from simpler classes. The way to do so is described in the classes'
constructors. For example, if I have a class "Triangle" which has a
constructor accepting three "Point" instances, and class "Point" has
a constructor accepting two integer objects, then these describe how
a Point can be constructed from two integers, and a Triangle from
three Point objects.
<P>
XParam takes advantage of this by allowing you to define the value of
a parameter of type Triangle in this way: "Triangle(Point(5,7),
Point(1,10), Point(3,6) )". This line is handled in much the same way
as it would have been handled inside a C++ program. First, all the
integer literals are recognized. Second, three Point objects are
constructed using the Point-from-two-integers constructor. Last, the
desired Triangle is constructed using the Triangle-from-three-Points
constructor.
<P>
In addition to simple class names, XParam can also recognize class names
that are template specializations. For example: "Matrix&lt;const int*&gt;"
is a legal class names in XParam. The words "Matrix", "const" and "int",
int this example, are considered literals, in the sense that no white
space can appear in the middle of them. XParam also disallows the use of
white space between the first literal in a class name and the symbol
immediately following it (which will be '(' if the literal is the entire
name of the class, '&lt;' if it is a template name, and '::' if it is a
scope qualifier). This is meant to enable XParam's parser to efficiently
distinguish between class names and relaxed string literals. (see the
section regarding <A HREF="#relaxedtypematching">Relaxed Type Matching</A>
for an explanation of relaxed string literals.)
<P>
With these exceptions, white space is allowed anywhere inside a
parameter value.
<P>
Note that this line "Triangle(Point(5,7), Point(1,10), @thirdpoint.txt)"
is also allowed. The third point of the triangle is read from the file
"thirdpoint.txt". This is simply a parameter value redirection, where
the read value is used as part of a more complex value.
<P>
In general, XParam only uses object constructors and conversion operators
in order to construct objects. However, in a few cases, the programmer
of the classes may have neglected to provide suitable or
convenient constructors for his classes, for a number of reasons.
To circumvent this problem, XParam allows the class registrator
to provide other functions, beside class constructors,
that create instances of the required type. From a user's point-of-view,
these creators are indistinguishable from regular constructors. For
this reason, you may find that some "constructors" you use in XParam
are not available to you inside C++ programs.
<P>
XParam class names, such as <TT>Triangle</TT>, are usually the same as
the names of the C++ classes they represent. However, in some cases,
we have opted for abbreviations. The <TT>std::vector&lt;T&gt;</TT> and
the <TT>std::string</TT> classes, for example, are called
<TT>vector&lt;T&gt;</TT> and <TT>string</TT> respectively in XParam.
This is merely an abbreviation. XParam can handle fully qualified names
such as <TT>std::basic_string&lt;char, std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;,
std::allocator&lt;char&gt; &gt;</TT>, but these are much more
cumbersome to use. On the other hand, no XParam class name can include
a modifier. Therefore <TT>long int</TT>, <TT>const double</TT>,
<TT>unsigned char</TT>, <TT>static float</TT> and <TT>volatile string</TT>
are all unallowed as XParam class names. In general, <TT>volatile</TT>
and <TT>static</TT> are considered to be unuseful modifiers in the
XParam context, <TT>const</TT>, which is generally meaningful only
in the context of argument passing mode, is handled transparently by
XParam, as is discussed in the <A HREF="#pointersyntax">Pointer Syntax</A>
section, and <TT>long</TT> and <TT>unsigned</TT>, which are allowed
only for the basic types, have been integrated as part of the
registered class name: XParam uses <TT>long</TT>, <TT>uchar</TT>,
<TT>ushort</TT>, <TT>uint</TT> and <TT>ulong</TT> instead of <TT>long int</TT>,
<TT>unsigned char</TT>, <TT>unsigned short</TT>, <TT>unsigned int</TT>
and <TT>unsigned long int</TT>,
respectively. As these types are hardly ever explicitly converted to,
one rarely needs to use these names in actual invocations.
On systems that support these types, XParam also defines
<TT>longlong</TT>, <TT>ulonglong</TT> and <TT>long_double</TT>, which
are the C++ types <TT>long long</TT>, <TT>unsigned long long</TT> and
<TT>long double</TT> respectively.
<P>
If you want to use a certain class, but are not sure what
constructors are available for it, use the format
<P>
<TT>
~/bin&gt; a.out ! <I>classname</I>
</TT>
<P>
This will give you full information about the class, in a user-friendly
format. Instead of the classname, you can also enter the name of a
constant of the class type, with the same effect. Constants are explained
in detail in the next section.
<A NAME="constants"><H4>Constants</H4></A>
In addition to explicitly built parameters, XParam also allows you to use
constants in your variable initializations. The registrator can define
constants of any XParam-recognized class, as well as any enums.
In addition to this, there are
several constants which have been pre-defined: "true" and "false" are
booleans, "NaN" is that ISO not-a-number of type double (also functioning
as a positive and negative infinity), "NaNF" is its
equivalent float and "NaNL" is the long double version, if your compiler
supports long doubles. Last but not least, "NULL" can match any pointer type.
<P>
The syntax for constants is very simple: simply use their name in your
definition. For example:
<P>
<TT>
~/bin&gt; my_prog b = false
</TT>
<P>
will assign the value 'false' to 'b', if 'b' is a variable of type boolean.
<P>
As all parameter values, constants can be used as constructor parameters
to build other classes, and can undergo conversions.
<A NAME="flags"><H4>Flags</H4></A>
One exception to the <TT><I>parameter_name</I> = <I>parameter_value</I></TT>
sequence is the use of flags. XParam allows the syntax
<P>
<PRE>
-<I>parameter_name</I>
</PRE>
<P>
to be used instead of
<TT><I>parameter_name</I>=true</TT> and
<P>
<PRE>
-no_<I>parameter_name</I>
</PRE>
<P>
to be used instead of <TT><I>parameter_name</I>=false</TT>, if
<TT><I>parameter_name</I></TT> is a parameter of type bool. The two
notations are completely interchangeable. XParam does not support
flags that have names starting with <TT>no_</TT>. Behavior of
XParam if such a flag is used is undefined.
<A NAME="relaxedtypematching"><H4>Relaxed Type Matching</H4></A>
Often, it is cumbersome to write <TT>name="Mary"</TT> instead of
<TT>name=Mary</TT>. This is especially true on the command-line in a
Unix environment, because shell parsing would require you to write
<TT>'name="Mary"'</TT> for the quotation marks not to disappear in
the parsing. To alleviate this problem, XParam provides a more
relaxed user interface, in which tentative
type matching is allowed in the stage of explicit literals.
<P>
If we look at the example <TT>name=Mary</TT> more closely, we can see
that <TT>Mary</TT> can not be parsed as anything other than a string.
It's too long to be a character, isn't entirely composed of digits,
and doesn't have parentheses which may indicate that this is a complex
parameter value. The only remaining option is a string literal constant.
<P>
Here's another example: <TT>num=7</TT>. If <TT>num</TT> is defined as
an integer, then the <TT>7</TT> will also have to be an integer, for if
it is treated as a string, instead, there will be no way to convert it to an
integer, for it to be assigned into <TT>num</TT>. This is known as
destination driven type matching. Though C++ doesn't support this form of
type matching, it is nevertheless an accepted form of strict-typed syntax,
and XParam makes full use of it.
<P>
It is therefore often possible, only by looking at the context in which
literal constants are used, to deduce their type. When this is the case,
XParam does not require you to use quotation marks or apostrophes around
your string and character literals. XParam considers the literal to be
of a "tentative" type until the exact type can be deduced, or, in cases
of ambiguity, notifies the program that the type can not be deduced.
The program will then most likely choose to report this and halt.
<P>
If you wish to explicitly state the type of your literal, you can always
do so, by using the full syntax detailed in the
<A HREF="#basicparametervalues">Basic Parameter Values</A> section. The
relaxed syntax is meant for your convenience, and in no way compromises
XParam's type strictness.
<P>
Specifically in the case of tentative types that can only be resolved as
strings, we have imposed several restrictions on XParam, so that not
any arbitrary string of characters will be recognizeable as a string.
There are two reasons for these restrictions:
<OL>
<LI>So that strings will not be confusable with the rest of the XParam
syntax. For example: "int(7)", if not quoted, can be parsed as a legal
integer initialization. We have also added restrictions meant for
syntax extensions we mean to add in the future.</LI>
<LI>So that strings will not be confusable with typing errors. For
example, "int(7", if not quoted, is not a legal integer initialization,
but is nevertheless more likely to be a typing error than an
intentionally typed string.</LI>
</OL>
Generally, the guidelines we used to define what a tentative string
can match were designed so that any ordinary file name will be
accepted.
<P>
However, you should be aware that XParam makes its best efforts to
make any input you give it into a legal initialization, and in doing
so can actually misinterpret user errors into legal initializations
that the user didn't mean. Here's one example: suppose that "duck"
has a normal construction from a string and an explicit construction
from an integer. This would mean that both "d=some_string" and
"d=duck(7)" are legitimate initializations. However, if you, by
accident, typed in "d=7", you would probably expect XParam to tell
you that this is not a valid initialization. Well, it is and it
won't: the "7" can be interpreted as a string, in which case the
initialization can be completed as read, and that's exactly what
XParam will do.

<A NAME="lists"><H4>Vectors, Lists, Sets and Globs</H4></A>

Another tentative type recognized by XParam is the heterogenous value list.
This is denoted by a sequence of values separated by commas that is placed
within brackets. For example:
<P>
<TT>
[ Point(1,1), Point (1,10), Point(10,10), Point(8,2) ]
</TT>
<P>
A heterogenous value list, or HVL for short, can be the converted into
other, more directly accessible types.
Out-of-the-box, XParam comes with
the ability to convert HVLs to the following class types:
<UL>
<LI><TT>st::vector&lt;<I>T</I>&gt;</TT></LI>
<LI><TT>st::list&lt;<I>T</I>&gt;</TT></LI>
<LI><TT>st::set&lt;<I>T</I>&gt;</TT></LI>
</UL>
The XParam registrator can
add more types which can be constructed from value lists.
<P>
The conversion from an HVL to a different type is done
by converting all the elements in the list to type <TT><I>T</I></TT>,
and using them as the elements of the constructed object.
XParam tries to deduce the relevant type
<TT><I>T</I></TT>
according to the types of the elements in the value-list and by the context
in which it is used. If no relevant type is found, or if an
ambiguity occurs, an XParam user-error will be thrown.
Here's an example of assigning to an <TT>std::list</TT>.
<P>
<TT>
my_list = [1, 2.3, -4]
</TT>
<P>
If the parameter <TT><I>my_list</I></TT> is an <TT>std::list&lt;int&gt;</TT>
then all the elements will
be converted to <TT>int</TT>s. If it's a
<TT>std::list&lt;double&gt;</TT> then the
elements will
be converted to <TT>double</TT>s. It is also possible to specify the type
explicitly:
<P>
<TT>
my_list = list&lt;int&gt;([1, 2.3, -4])
</TT>
<P>
In addition to constructing a <TT>vector</TT> or <TT>list</TT> by
providing all the elements
explicitly, in XParam a <TT>vector</TT> or <TT>list</TT> can also be
initialized in the usual C++ way, using
either default constructor
<P>
<TT>
vector&lt;int&gt;() # an empty vector
</TT>
<P>
or using a constructor with two arguments - the number of elements, and a value
which will be used for all the elements:
<P>
<TT>
vector&lt;int&gt;(3,7) # same as [7,7,7]
</TT>
<P>
The <TT>std::list</TT> can be constructed using its default constructor.
<P>
Because brackets are also characters that are used by the shell,
XParam provides a relaxed syntax here, too. If your value-list is two
or more elements long, the brackets can be omitted, and XParam
will be able to tell that this is a value-list by looking at the
commas separating the elements. This relaxed syntax is only
available on the top-level of an assignment, not in any other
context. So, this:
<P>
<TT>
a = [ 1, 2, 3 ]
</TT>
<P>
is equivalent to this:
<P>
<TT>
a = 1, 2, 3
</TT>
<P>
but in the following two examples, no relaxed syntax is allowed:
<P>
<TT>
a=duck([ 1, 2, 3 ]) # value as a constructor argument<br>
[1, 2, 3] # just a value - no assignment
</TT>
<P>
One more syntax for inputting vectors is available in XParam. It is the glob.
A glob is an assignment that looks like this:
<P>
<TT>
~/&gt; my_program a = : one two three :
</TT>
<P>
The syntax is composed of an openning colon followed by the items in the
vector, with a closing colon at the end. This syntax is only available in
the shell, because the separation of the list into objects is not done,
as in all other lists, by commas. Instead, items are separated using
shell separators. A shell separator is expected after the initial colon,
before the closing colon, and between each pair of items in the list.
<P>
This syntax is useful, as its name suggests, in globbing scenarios.
Consider, for example, the following initialization line:
<P>
<TT>
~/&gt; my_program my_files = : *.c *.o :
</TT>
<P>
If you're in a Unix shell, that parses the wildcards for you, before they
are input into the program, then this command-line would initialize the
parameter <TT>my_files</TT> as a vector of all filenames in the current
directory ending in either "<TT>.c</TT>" or "<TT>.o</TT>".
<P>
For convenience, if the closing colon is the last character on the input
line, it may be omitted.
<P>
Things to note about the globbing syntax:
<OL>
<LI>This syntax only allows the initialization of values whose type is
<TT>vector&lt;string&gt;</TT>, and no other type.</LI>
<LI>The names in the globbed list are not "tentative literals", as may
be expected. Within a glob, XParam is very liberal regarding what it
may take for a string. This includes, for example, items containing
white-space characters. XParam only uses shell separators, within globs,
in order to separate or truncate names. The only restriction this
imposes is that no string in the list may start with a colon, or else
XParam will confuse it with the colon signifying the end of the glob.</LI>
</OL>
<A NAME="maps"><H4>Maps</H4></A>
XParam provides the following syntax for conveniently initialzing 
the C++ types <TT>std::map&lt;<I>KEY</I>,<I>VALUE</I>&gt;</TT>:
<P>
<TT>
{ <I>key1</I> => <I>value1</I>, <I>key2</I> => <I>value2</I>, <I>...</I> }
</TT>
<P>
Finding the correct types <TT><I>KEY</I></TT> and <TT><I>VALUE</I></TT>
is done by methods similar to
those used for <TT>vector</TT>s and <TT>list</TT>s,
and depends on the actual values used
in the <TT>map</TT>, as well as on the context in which the
<TT>map</TT> is used. 
For example, the following assignment:
<P>
<TT>
my_map = { 3 => 9, 4 => 16, 5 => 25 }
</TT>
<P>
will work if <TT><I>my_map</I></TT> is of type <TT>map&lt;int,int&gt;</TT>
or <TT>map&lt;int,double&gt;</TT>, 
or even <TT>map&lt;double,string&gt;</TT>.
<P>
The following assignment will work for
<TT>map&lt;double,string&gt;</TT>,
but will produce an XParam error in the case of 
<TT>map&lt;int,int&gt;</TT> or <TT>map&lt;int,double&gt;</TT>:
<P>
<TT>
my_map = { 3 => "9", 4 => abc, 5 => 25 }
</TT>
<A NAME="pointersyntax"><H4>Pointer Syntax</H4></A>
Some classes expect pointers to be passed on to them in constructors.
In XParam, unlike in C++, you do not need to use special syntax in
order to signify the fact that you are passing an object by pointer.
Consider the following example:
<P>
<TT>
my_variable = ClassA( ClassB() )
</TT>
<P>
Looking at this syntax, it is impossible to tell, in XParam, whether
ClassA's constructor expects a ClassB instance to be passed on to it
by value, by constant reference or by pointer. Furthermore, it is
impossible to tell whether my_variable, inside the C++ program, is
a class instance or a class pointer. This leads to a very simple
and straight-forward syntax for the XParam user. The drawback is
that if a class has two constructors, one from a ClassB constant
reference and the other from a pointer to ClassB, they can not both
be registered as is. In the section dealing with registration
interface we will return to this problem and show workarounds, but
this problem is highly esoteric and hardly ever encountered.
<P>
Note that because <TT><I>my_variable</I></TT> in the example can be
of type <TT>ClassA*</TT> just as well as it can be a <TT>ClassA</TT>
instance, XParam allows the same syntax to be used to enable
polymorphism. Consider the fact that <TT><I>my_variable</I></TT>
can just as well be a pointer to a base class, from which ClassA
is derived. XParam allows this use, and even enables
<TT><I>my_variable</I></TT> to be a pointer to an abstract class.
Consider this example:
<P>
<TT>
my_window=Window(Point(0,0),Point(100,100),Circle(Point(10,10),5))
</TT>
<P>
In this example, the user initializes a variable of type "Window",
which will be in charge of a window on the graphic screen. The
first two parameters indicate two corners of this window,
establishing its position. The last, optional, parameter indicates
which shape will be drawn inside this window initially. This
parameter is of type <TT>Shape*</TT>, which is a pointer to
an abstract class. The user, however, wrote <TT>Circle(...)</TT>,
which XParam takes to be a pointer to a Circle, which will
be used polymorphically as a <TT>Shape*</TT> object.
<P>
One particularly interesting use for this polymorphism is strategy
management. For example, supposing my program displays URLs. It
receives parameter "url" which will denote which URL to display.
Variable "url" will be of type "URL*", where "URL" is an abstract
class. The information of which protocol to use becomes part of the
class information: <TT>url=HTTP("sourceforge.net")</TT> may be
very different than <TT>url=FTP("sourceforge.net")</TT>.
<P>
In the registration section, we will go over how to dynamically link
classes HTTP and FTP on the fly, when necessary, but for the user
of XParam, when dynamically loading class libraries becomes necessary,
it is performed automatically and unobtrusively. The user need not
even know which of the classes she uses is statically linked and
which dynamically.
<A NAME="conversions"><H4>Conversions</H4></A>
Throughout the discussion, we have often mentioned conversions.
XParam allows conversions, both implicit and explicit, adhering to
rules similar to those used by C++. XParam will always try to find
the best possible conversion path, but can encounter situations in
which no possible conversion path is found or more than one equally
good conversion path can be considered the best. If such a case is
encountered, an XParam user-error will be thrown.
<P>
For example: <TT>my_double=7</TT> will cause the <TT>7</TT>, an integer,
to be cast into a double, with the value 7.0, which will then be assigned
to the variable <TT>my_double</TT> of type double. This calls for a
conversion between two built-in C++ types.
<P>
Another example would be <TT>my_swan=ugly_duckling()</TT>. Here, a
value of type <TT>ugly_duckling</TT> is assigned into a variable of type
<TT>swan</TT>. For this to succeed, XParam must find a way to convert
an <TT>ugly_duckling</TT> into a <TT>swan</TT>. This is a user-defined
conversion. As in C++, user-defined conversions receive a lower priority
than conversions between built-in types.
<P>
The previous two examples were rather straight-forward. However, conversion
sequences can be arbitrarily complex.
Consider, for example, the execution line mentioned in the introduction:
<P>
<TT>
~/bin&gt;a.out 'my_shape=[ Circle(Point(50,50),50), Circle(Point(25,75),10),
Circle(Point(75,75),10), Arc(Point(25,50), Point(50,25), Point(75,50)) ]'
</TT>
<P>
In the introduction, "my_shape" was considered to be a "Composite" object,
but it can just as well be a pointer to a "Shape" object. Here's how this
works:
<P>
First, a list containing three circles and one arc is created.
The construction
of these involves no casting whatsoever, implicit or explicit, but,
conceivably, "Point"'s constructor could have expected two doubles, instead
of two integers, in which case XParam would have silently and implicitly
converted the integers to doubles. Next, the list of two circles and one
arc is converted to an <TT>std::vector&lt;Shape*&gt;</TT> type.
Note that for this to
happen, the circles and the arc had to be implicitly considered to be
pointers, instead of class instances, and had to then be upcast to their
abstract base class Shape, so as to become "Shape*" objects. Once this
is done, the std::vector&lt;Shape*&gt; is taken to be the single argument in
the constructor of a "Composite" object - this is a user-defined conversion
constructor. And finally, the "Composite" object is considered to be a
pointer object, too, and upcast to its abstract base class, "Shape",
becoming a polymorphic "Shape*" object, which can now be assigned to the
relevant C++ variable.
<P>
All the necessary conversions along the path are silently and implicitly
handled by XParam, with no manual involvement necessary.
