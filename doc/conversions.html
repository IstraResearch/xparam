<H4><A NAME="introduction">Introduction</A></H4>
In using XParam, it is common to utilize the fact that not all conversions
must be explicitly requested. Often, XParam performs implicit
conversions in order to execute a command.
The following is a description of XParam's implicit conversion rules.
It is not intended to be the definitive guide to the rules. Some rules
may be a little more complex than they are presented here. This
appendix is meant, however, to help you understand better why
XParam chooses one conversion path over another, for this to assist
you in controlling its behavior, whether as a user or as a registrator.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="weights">The Weights</A></H4>
As C++, XParam recognizes that not all conversions are alike.
Certain conversions, such as one from <TT>bool</TT> to <TT>int</TT>,
look more appealing than others, such as from <TT>double</TT> to <TT>int</TT>.
This is expressed in the form of weights. The more weight a conversion
carries, the less attractive it seems. XParam recognizes several basic
weights:
<OL>
<LI><B>CONV_EXACT</B> - a conversion between a type and itself. Its weight is essentially zero.</LI>
<LI><B>CONV_PROMOTION</B> - a conversion from a <TT>bool</TT> to an
<TT>int</TT> or from an
<TT>unsigned char</TT> to an <TT>unsigned int</TT>.</LI>
<LI><B>CONV_STANDARD</B> - any conversion between two built-in C++
types other than those covered by CONV_PROMOTIONs and those involving type
<TT>char</TT>.</LI>
<LI><B>CONV_TO_PARENT</B> - a conversion between a pointer to
a base type and a pointer to its parent type.</LI>
<LI><B>CONV_USER</B> - any conversion not covered by
previous rules. This is the default weight whenever a new conversion
is registered by the user.</LI>
</OL>
The weights are listed here in order of increasing weight. The difference
in weight between any two is infinite, so, for example, a sequence of any
number of CONV_TO_PARENT conversions is still considered more
appealing than a single CONV_USER. Note that XParam does
not consider a switch from an object to a pointer to bear any weight.
<P>
With the exception of value-lists, explained below, the weight of
a conversion path is considered to be the sum of the weights of all
conversions along it. No more than one CONV_USER is
allowed on a conversion path.
<P>
XParam will always choose the lightest available conversion path.
If no conversion path can be considered lightest (for example, if
two conversion paths are exactly as good) then XParam will call
this an ambiguity.
<P>
This is more or less how C++ evaluates conversions, too. The main
difference is that, in XParam, all conversions between type <TT>char</TT>
and other built-in C++ types (numeric types) must be specified explicitly.
<H4><A NAME="tentative">Tentative Types</A></H4>
In C++, all explicit literal constants have a type. You specify
strings by quotation marks, characters by apostrophes, single
precision floating point decimals by a trailing 'f', and so on.
<P>
Because XParam works most commonly from the command-line, a more
relaxed syntax is allowed in XParam to minimize the necessity of
using characters that have meaning in Unix shell-parsing, such as
quotations and apostrophes. For this reason, an assignment such
as this:
<P>
<TT>
my_parameter = 7
</TT>
<P>
can be interpretted with the character <TT>7</TT> representing an
explicit literal constant of type <TT>int</TT>, <TT>char</TT> or
even <TT>std::string</TT>. XParam resolves this ambiguity by use
of "tentative types" and destination-driven type matching. In
essence, what this means is that XParam checks what types of
explicit literal constants are permitted in the given context
(for example, by checking the type of <TT>my_parameter</TT>)
and then what types the given literal matches (in
this case: <TT>int</TT>,<TT>char</TT> and <TT>std::string</TT>).
Of the remaining options, XParam chooses according to the following
rules:
<UL>
<LI>A numeric type is preferable to a non-numeric type.</LI>
<LI>A <TT>char</TT> is preferable to an <TT>std::string</TT>.</LI>
</UL>
Remember that it is always possible to override these rules by
explicitly specifying your desired type (for example, by adding
quotation marks or apostrophes).
<H4><A NAME="lists">List Comparisons</A></H4>
List comparisons are different than scalar comparisons. Weighing them,
in fact, looks very similar to the algorithm used by C++ (and XParam)
to choose between overloaded functions and methods.
<P>
When choosing between "func(int,int)" and "func(long,long)" when
receiving an input, for example "func(3,5L)", C++ weighs each
element separately, so the distance from "func(3,5L)" to
"func(int,int)" is (CONV_EXACT, CONV_STANDARD), and the
distance from "func(3,5L)" to "func(long,long)" is
(CONV_STANDARD, CONV_EXACT). Now, we must determine which
of these possibilities is better. The way to do it is to go
element by element and compare. If one option is at-least as
good as any other option in all elements, and better than all
other options in at least one element, then it is considered
the best. If two options are exactly as good in all
elements, then the two options are considered to be as good, as a whole.
If, on the other hand, as is the case here, when comparing two
options there is an element that is better in one and another
element that is better in the other, then the two options
are considered incomparable. If asked to choose between them,
both C++ and XParam will determine that this is an ambiguity.
<P>
XParam takes this element-by-element approach in lists, as well.
If <TT>school</TT>, for example, is a class that can be constructed from
a vector of integers or from a vector of <TT>fish</TT>, and the
initialization line is "elementary=[ 4L, 5L ]", where "elementary"
is a variable of type <TT>school</TT>, then XParam must
now choose between converting "[4L, 5L]", element by element,
into a list of integers, "[4, 5]", which can be converted into
an <TT>std::vector&lt;int&gt;</TT>, and converting the
"[4L, 5L]", element-by-element, into a list of <TT>fish</TT>,
"[fish(4L), fish(5L)]", and from there to a <TT>std::vector&lt;fish&gt;</TT>.
<P>
Supposing class <TT>fish</TT> has a constructor from <TT>long</TT>,
then the first option weighs (CONV_STANDARD, CONV_STANDARD)
and the second option weighs (CONV_USER,
CONV_USER). Therefore, XParam will choose going through
a vector of integers.
<P>
Let's, however, make this example more complicated. What if
"elementary" was not of type <TT>school</TT> but of type <TT>school*</TT>,
and <TT>school</TT> was a parent class to <TT>public_school*</TT>,
and, furthermore, that it is not <TT>school</TT> that has a constructor
from a vector of integers but <TT>public_school</TT>?
<P>
If we sort through all the details, we'll find that XParam must now
choose between two paths:
<P>
untyped list -&gt; list of <TT>fish</TT> -&gt; <TT>std::vector&lt;fish&gt;</TT>
 -&gt; <TT>school</TT>
<P>
and
<P>
untyped list -&gt; list of <TT>int</TT> -&gt; <TT>std::vector&lt;int&gt;</TT>
-&gt; <TT>public_school</TT> -&gt; <TT>school</TT>
<P>
We know that it is easier to go from our list to a vector of integers than
it is to go to a vector of <TT>fish</TT>. However, once we get there, it
weighs more to go from integers to <TT>school*</TT> than it is from
<TT>fish</TT> to <TT>school*</TT>. Which will XParam choose? The rule
is that any conversions that are done after an HVL-to-class conversion
bare a negligent weight compared to what is done prior to the conversion.
So, in this case, XParam will still decide to go through
<TT>std::vector&lt;int&gt;</TT>. If the two conversions, until the switch
from HVL to vector, had been uncomparable, then the entire paths would
have been uncomparable. Only if the two conversion paths had been of
equivalent weights  until the switch from HVL to vector, the weights
of the latter part of the conversion path would have had effect.
