The following sections describe three examples of XParam programs
in order of increasing sophistication. The full compileable sources
and run-able binaries can be found in the "examples" directory of the
XParam distribution. If you've installed the xparam-devel RPM, you
will find these examples in a tar ball, in the same directory as
this documentation.
<P>
The files referenced by this HTML have been abbreviated, for
clarity, by omitting a large part of the license notice at the beginning
of each. The code, however, is still protected by the same license as the
rest of XParam. Other than this change, the files are identical to those
used in the actual working code.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="simpleexample">Simple Example</A></H4>
This little C++ program demonstrates a very simple usage of XParam.
It asks for two inputs, an integer called "num" and a string
called "name". "num" is a number you're guessing; "name" is your
name. The program reads this input from the command line. Next
it reads an integer from the file
<A HREF="doc_examples/my_number.txt">my_number.txt</A> and sees whether
you guessed too high or too low. Finally, the program outputs
"my_number" as a ParamSet, in the format recognizeable by other
XParam programs, which is also human-readable.
<P>
You can execute this program with no parameters, and will receive
the reply that "num" is a required parameter. You can input "num"
only, in which case the program will enter the default name:
"John Doe", or you can enter both parameters. You can also
execute this program with the help-request option:
<P>
<TT>
~&gt; simple !
</TT>
<P>
for example, and this will give you all the parameter information.
<P>
One particularly amusing way to execute this program is by using
<P>
<TT>
~&gt; simple num=@my_number.txt
</TT>
<P>
This will redirect "num" to be read from "my_number.txt", which,
of course, will lead to your number being exactly correct.
<P>
The full code can be found in
<A HREF="doc_examples/simple.cpp">simple.cpp</A>.

A more involved example is the example of initializing an entire
drawing, using a polymorphic Shape pointer. This example is given
in <A HREF="doc_examples/involved.cpp">involved.cpp</A>.
The generic shape interface is given in
<A HREF="doc_examples/shapes.h">shapes.h</A> and its
implementation is in
<A HREF="doc_examples/shapes.cpp">shapes.cpp</A>. The
interface is registered in
<A HREF="doc_examples/reg_shapes.cpp">reg_shapes.cpp</A>.
<P>
You can execute this program using
<P>
<TT>
~&gt; bin/involved @data/my_shape.txt
</TT>
<P>
This will load the shape information from the file
<A HREF="doc_examples/my_shape.txt">my_shape.txt</A>.
The shape information itself uses class "Circle", which has not been
defined in "shapes.h". Consequently, XParam will dynamically load
the dynamic link library that was compiled from the
files <A HREF="doc_examples/circle.cpp">circle.cpp</A> and
<A HREF="doc_examples/reg_circle.cpp">reg_circle.cpp</A>
(the command to do so is in
<A HREF="doc_examples/circle.xpn">circle.xpn</A>).
These files implement and register the circle class, whose interface appears in
<A HREF="doc_examples/circle.h">circle.h</A>.
<P>
This program demonstrates parameter passing with user-defined
classes and dynamic loading. For it to work, you must make sure
that environment variable XPARAM_CLASSPATH is set, and that the
path of <A HREF="doc_examples/circle.xpn">circle.xpn</A>
appears in it. 
<P>
Note: XParam does not currently support dynamic loading in Windows,
so for the example to work in Windows you will have to link in the
files <A HREF="doc_examples/circle.cpp">circle.cpp</A> and
<A HREF="doc_examples/reg_circle.cpp">reg_circle.cpp</A>
statically.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="calculatorexample">Calculator Example</A></H4>
This program demonstrates an interactive usage of streams. The
main program code appears in
<A HREF="doc_examples/calculator.cpp">calculator.cpp</A>.
This is all the code you need to program a calculator in XParam,
because all the parsing is done by XParam for you. However, you
still need to program classes for the different arithmetic
operations. These classes appear in
<A HREF="doc_examples/functions.h">functions.h</A> and
<A HREF="doc_examples/functions.cpp">functions.cpp</A>.
They are registered into XParam in
<A HREF="doc_examples/reg_functions.cpp">reg_functions.cpp</A>.
With these files alone, this is already a functioning calculator.
<P>
However, we also wanted to demonstrate that the calculator is easily
extendable. By adding the files
<A HREF="doc_examples/mathfunc.h">mathfunc.h</A>,
<A HREF="doc_examples/reg_mathfunc.cpp">reg_mathfunc.cpp</A> and
<A HREF="doc_examples/mathfunc.xpn">mathfunc.xpn</A> we
managed to add two functions, "sqrt" and "ln", which are loaded
dynamically when needed.
<P>
The program is a calculator, working on doubles, that supports the
functions "add", "sub", "mul" and "div" (as well as "sqrt" and "ln").
It reads its input as an input object stream from the standard input
and outputs its output as an output object stream to the standard
output. Errors go to the standard error. The calculator supports
commands that look like this: "mul(5,add(4,2))". This input will
cause it to output "30.0", because 5*(4+2)=30. The calculator also
supports variables. use "def(var1,13)" to define "var1" to be "13".
Variable names are general strings. To use the variable, simply use
its name: "sub(var1,8)" will output "5.0". To exit the calculator,
simple truncate the input stream (^D in Unix or ^Z under Windows).
<P>
Another thing you can do is import an object, by using the redirection
operator. A single object may contain many variable definitions. This
is done by placing them between brackets. Use "@data/constants.dat" to
import Pi and E from
<A HREF="doc_examples/constants.dat">constants.dat</A>,
for example.
<P>
Calculator also demonstrates another use-case for paramsets. Though
there is no command-line input needed for the calculator, it
nevertheless uses a paramset to read the command line. This allows
the calculator to give usage instructions with the "!" directive,
as well as help on specific functions.
<P>
The main thing to note about the calculator is that no concessions
had to be made regarding its interface (with the exception that it
has to use functions instead of operators), because of the use of
XParam. Correct design of the class hierarchy it uses makes it possible
for you to write "15" and it to be accepted as a number, "max" and it
to be accepted as a variable, "[ def(one,1), def(two,2) ]" and for
that to be accepted as a list of definitions, a single redirection
to import many variables, any format of double to be readable,
usage of "div" and "sqrt", even though these are functions that already
have a meaning in C++, and so on. On the output side, the
interface provides output as soon as you finish writing an expression,
it outputs a stream of XParam doubles, readable by other
XParam-supporting programs,
when you input a calculation, and nothing when you input a definition
or a list of definitions - these were all design goals.
<P>
The class hierarchy in the calculator program makes XParam implicitly
convert values to the type you need them in, in order for the user
not to have to be at all aware of the existence of classes such as
<TT>ArithValue</TT>, <TT>Expression</TT> and <TT>MultiDef</TT>. She
will only ever encounter them in error messages.
